# Environment Variables for All Services

This document describes all environment variables used by the SkillForge microservices (gateway, user, course), their
purpose, default values, and usage. It also explains how to configure your environment for local development, Docker,
and production.

| `SERVER_PORT_USER`       | user                  | Port for user service (internal, not exposed in Docker)         | `8082`                             |                                       |

| `SERVER_PORT_GATEWAY`    | gateway               | Port for API gateway                                            | `8081`                             | Exposed as `0.0.0.0:8081` in Docker   |
| `SERVER_HOST_USER`       | gateway               | Host for user service (internal)                                | `user-service`                     | Used by gateway to route requests     |

## üóÑÔ∏è **MongoDB Configuration**

- **Unified URI:**
    - Both user and course services use the same `MONGO_URL` variable.
    - Default is: `mongodb://mongo:27017/skillforge`
    - Must be changed in the Production environment to point to your MongoDB instance.
    - The database name is the last segment of the URI (`skillforge`).
    - Collections for users and courses are created automatically by the services.

- **Local Development:**
    - Use `localhost` instead of `mongo` if running MongoDB outside Docker:
        - `MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/skillforge`

- **Production (MongoDB Atlas):**
    - Use your Atlas connection string:
        - `MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/skillforge?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

---

## üîí **JWT & Security**

- `JWT_SECRET` **must** be the same for user, course and gateway services.
- Never commit your real secret to version control.
- For local/dev, you can set a default in `.env` or Docker Compose, but override in production.

---

## üö¶ **Ports & Networking**

- Only the gateway exposes a port to the host (`8081`).
- User and course services are only accessible via the gateway.
- All services are on the `skillforge-network` Docker network.

---

## ü©∫ **Health Endpoints**

- Each service exposes a health endpoint that pings MongoDB:
    - User:   `GET /api/v1/users/health`
    - Course: `GET /api/v1/courses/health`
    - Gateway: `GET /actuator/health` (Spring Boot default)
- These endpoints return 200 OK if reachable (and MongoDB is connected for user/course).

---

## üìù **Example simple .env for Local Docker Compose**

Those variables must be set in your `.env` file or Docker Compose environment section for local development:

```dotenv
MONGO_URL=mongodb://mongo:27017/skillforge
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-key-here
```

---

## üîó **Service Connections**

- **Gateway** routes all external traffic to user and course services.
- **User/Course** services connect to MongoDB using `MONGO_URL`.
- **Redis** is used by the gateway for rate limiting and caching.
- All services are discoverable by Docker Compose service name (e.g., `mongo`, `redis`).
