## 1. Problem Statement

Keeping up with technology is hard because there's too much information online (information overload). It's difficult for tech professionals and students to find high-quality articles, news, and tutorials that are relevant to them. Learning new skills often feels confusing without a clear plan, as useful content is scattered across many websites. This means people waste a lot of time searching and can easily miss important updates or struggle to learn effectively. While some websites gather tech news, they often don't personalize it well or help users learn step-by-step.  
Our application solves this by creating a smart platform that makes it easier to find, understand, and learn from technical content.

### What is the main functionality?

- **Content Aggregation**: Automatically collect and classify technical articles, blog posts, and tutorials from a curated list of trustworthy sources.

- **Content Summarization**: Use generative AI to produce concise and accurate summaries of aggregated content, enabling users to quickly understand the key points without extensive reading.

- **Personalized Recommendation**: Show users content that matches their specific interests, job roles, and learning goals using AI.
- **Learning Path Generation**: Create structured, goal-oriented learning paths using aggregated content to help users learn specific tech skills.

---

### Who are the intended users?

- Software Developers, Engineers, and IT Professionals  
- Computer Science and Engineering Students  
- Lifelong learners or any person interested in staying current with new technologies  
- Beginners or individuals newly introduced to a technology and want to learn it quickly and efficiently without wasting time collecting the right resources

### How will we integrate GenAI meaningfully?

We will use Generative AI (using LangChain) as a key part of the application to provide real value:

- **AI Summaries**: To save users time by quickly summarizing long articles and documents.
AI Personalization: To find the right content for each user by understanding their interests and the topics of the articles better than simple keyword matching.

- **AI Learning Path Generation**: To give structure to learning by automatically creating logical, step-by-step learning plans for specific topics requested by the user, based on their background, previous skills, and knowledge gaps. 

- **AI Q&A (Potential Future Feature)**: Allow users to ask questions about the content, using AI (specifically RAG) to find and combine answers from the gathered articles.


## 2. Potential Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Daily Tech Update  
A software developer opens the app in the morning. They see a short list of summaries for new articles about technologies they care about (like "React" and "Cloud Security"), helping them stay informed quickly.

#### Scenario 2: A Developer Staying Current with Node.js and Learning AWS Step-by-Step  
Maria, a mid-level JavaScript developer, starts a new role involving AWS. While confident with Node.js, she‚Äôs new to AWS and needs to learn it quickly without wasting time. She also wants to stay updated on Node.js best practices and improvements. The app delivers a personalized daily feed with GenAI-generated summaries of Node.js updates, performance tips, and useful libraries. Alongside this, it provides a structured ‚ÄúDaily AWS Lesson‚Äù introducing services like IAM ‚Üí EC2 ‚Üí S3 ‚Üí Lambda in logical sequence, each with a short summary, tutorial link, and key takeaways. As Maria progresses, the system adapts her learning path and keeps her informed with relevant AWS news‚Äîall in one place.

#### Scenario 3: Understanding a Long Article  
An engineer comes across a 20-page technical document filled with complex information that might be relevant to their current work. Instead of reading the entire piece, they paste the link into the app. Within seconds, the app uses GenAI to generate a concise, bullet-point summary highlighting the key ideas. This allows the engineer to grasp the main points quickly and decide whether a deeper read is necessary‚Äîsaving valuable time.
